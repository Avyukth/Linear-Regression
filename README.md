# Linear-Regression

This is the code for the "How to Do Linear Regression " 
##Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/uwwWVAgJBcM) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval. I'm using a small dataset of student test scores and the amount of hours they studied. Intuitively, there must be a relationship right? The more you study, the better your test scores should be. We're going to use [linear regression](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/node/250) to prove this relationship. 

Here are some helpful links:
